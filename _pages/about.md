Hi, I'm Yi Fan!

I am about to complete my Master's degree in Informatics at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), specializing in IT Security and Cybersecurity. I also earned my Bachelor's degree at TUM, where I focused on Algorithms and Data Structures. You can access my CV [here](https://academicpages-fyind.netlify.app/cv/).

My research interests are:
